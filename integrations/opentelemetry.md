## OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTracing and OpenCensus merged to form OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application.




If your application uses OpenTelemetry, you can configure the application to send traces and metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
For detailed  instructions see:

- [Sending trace data to Tanzu Observability](https://docs.wavefront.com/opentelemetry_tracing.html).
- [Sending metrics data to Tanzu Observability](https://docs.wavefront.com/opentelemetry_metrics.html).

[Try out the Tutorials](https://docs.wavefront.com/opentelemetry_java_tutorial.html) to send your data to Tanzu Observability and then examine the data using dashboards and charts or tracing dashboards!
