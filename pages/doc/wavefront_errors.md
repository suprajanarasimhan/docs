<tr><td markdown="span">Query syntax error: Cannot aggregate more than 500000 series </td>
<td>Revise the query, for example:
<ul><li>
<a href="query_language_point_tags.html#point-tag-example">Filter by point tag.</a> </li>
<li><a href="query_language_getting_started.html#step-2-filter-by-source-and-point-tag">Filter by source.</a></li>
<li><a href="query_language_aggregate_functions.html#grouping-the-aggregation-results">Use grouping.</a> The example in the link uses grouping with an aggregation function, but you can use it with any function. </li></ul>
The techniques help you show the information that's actually useful.</td></tr>
