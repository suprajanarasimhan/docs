summary: Announcements and new and updated features in Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
---

This page lists new and updated features for the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront service. 

* For **Wavefront Proxy**, your go-to place is the [Wavefront proxy GitHub page](https://GitHub.com/wavefrontHQ/java/releases). On that page, you can see releases in progress and GA versions. If proxy changes are important for the service, we update this doc set, for example, with new configuration parameters, ports, etc.
* For the latest changes and releases of our **Integrations**, see the [Integrations Release Notes](integrations_new_changed.html).
* For **Observability for Kubernetes**, go to the [release notes for Wavefront Collector for Kubernetes GitHub repository](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-collector-for-kubernetes/releases).

## Announcements

* **Upcoming Removal of the Service Accounts from the Everyone Group**

    In the next release(s), the service accounts that are still part of the predefined **Everyone** group will be removed from this group. This will not impact any existing functionality and integrations. Last year, all service accounts were added to the new predefined **Service Accounts** group. See the [2021-42.x Release Notes](2021.49.x_release_notes.html#2021-42x-release-notes) for details.

    <!--- {% include important.html content="Ensure that the service accounts in your organization do not depend on the **Everyone** group permissions."%} --->

## 2022-09.x Release Notes

**Drilldown Links on Charts Improvement**: You can now use drilldown links to send users to a target section of a dashboard. See [How Do Drilldown Links Work](ui_charts_faq.html#how-do-drilldown-links-work).


## 2022-08.x Release Notes


**Usage Portal**: As more teams use the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront service within an enterprise, the central team (Super Admins) needs a better mechanism to track their points per second (PPS) usage, manage consumption, and also put limits to manage costs.

We have now made [monitoring](examine_usage.html) of the ingested PPS much easier. As a Wavefront Super Admin, you can track and monitor how ingested data is used, whether you will be billed for more data, and whether you will need to request more data. You can also create [ingestion policies](ingestion_policies.html) and monitor how different accounts contribute to the PPS usage.
