summary: Learn how to upgrade from a trial version and purchase Tanzu Observability.
---

When you create a Tanzu Observability by Wavefront account and register for the trial version, your trial expires after a month. One of the options that we offer to Tanzu Observability Super Admin users, is to purchase Tanzu Observability by themselves. Another option is to contact the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront sales team so that they guide you through the purchase process. For large commitments and more PPS, we strongly recommend the latter option. 

To purchase Tanzu Observability, you must either have a VMware Cloud services account or create one during the purchase process.

A Super Admin user can upgrade from trial version and purchase Tanzu Observability. 

Billing depends on the amount of data, measured in points per second (PPS), that you send to Tanzu Observability  on a monthly basis. If you exceed the contracted rate for more than 5% of the hours of a given month, you will be charged for the usage above it (the overages). In any case, you do not lose any of your data.
