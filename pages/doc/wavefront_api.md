summary: Learn about the REST API for managing Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
---

The Wavefront REST API enables you to write scripts to perform management tasks, such as defining alerts and creating events. You can use the REST API to perform any task that is supported by the Tanzu Observability GUI. The REST API is based on Swagger, so you can generate the API client of your choice (including a CLI client).



## REST API Overview

All interactions between the UI and your Wavefront instance occur through the Wavefront API. You can perform those actions using REST - or you can create an API client using Swagger, discussed below.

The current version of the REST API is v2. You can access the API at `<wavefront_instance>/api/v2`. The v1 API (`<wavefront_instance>/api/`) was deprecated in 2017 and is no longer supported.

{% include note.html content="The Wavefront REST API is not the same as the `/api` endpoint that you specify for the Wavefront proxy."%}


## API Documentation (Wavefront Instance)

Each Wavefront instance includes Swagger-generated documentation for the REST API. In our blog post [Did You Know that Our API Docs Are Alive](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/vmware-tanzu-observability-blog/did-you-know-that-our-api-docs-are-alive) we explain how you can experiment with our API directly from this in-product documentation.

To access the REST API documentation :

1. Log in to your Wavefront instance.
2. Display the doc from the UI or using a URL:
  * In the UI, click the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"/> at the top right of the toolbar and select **API Documentation**.
  * Type `https://<your_instance_name>.com/api-docs/ui/`

## API Documentation (VMware code)

If you don't have access to a Wavefront instance, you can have a look at our API doc [on the VMware code site](https://code.vmware.com/apis/714/wavefront-rest).

We include an overview and a Swagger-generated API Reference. We update the reference with each release.

The [VMware code website](https://code.vmware.com/samples?categories=Sample&tags=wavefront) also includes some samples, for example, for getting data into Tanzu Observability. We're providing these samples as is - some are from our team, others will come from the community.


## Invoking the API

You can invoke the API using `curl` or from an API client. In either case, you must pass in an API token.

### Generating an API Token

An API token is a string of hexadecimal characters and dashes. For example:

```
a411c16b-3cf7-4f03-bf11-8ca05aab898d
```
Tanzu Observability by Wavefront allows [user accounts](user-accounts.html) and [service accounts](service-accounts.html) to use the [Wavefront REST API](wavefront_api.html).

{% include tip.html content="You generate API tokens for user accounts explicitly. For service accounts, a user with the **Accounts** permission can generate tokens from the **Service Accounts** page." %}

#### Generate an API Token for Your User Account

{% include note.html content="All users can use and manage their existing API tokens. You must have the [API Tokens permission](permissions_overview.html) to generate new API tokens for your user account." %}


1. Log in to your Wavefront instance.
2. Click the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"/> at the top right of the toolbar and select your user name.
3. On the **API Access** tab, click **Generate**.

   You can have up to 20 tokens at any given time. If you want to generate a new token but already have 20 tokens, then you must revoke one of the existing tokens.
4. To revoke a token, click the **Revoke** button next to the token.

    If you run a script that uses a revoked token, the script returns an authorization error.

![Generate API Token](/images/generate_token.png)


{% include warning.html content="Do not share your API token with anyone. The token provides full access to the API. Accounts that have the token can authenticate without a username/password."%}

#### Generate an API Token for a Service Account

{% include note.html content="You must have the [**Accounts** permission](permissions_overview.html) to generate API tokens for your service accounts." %}

You generate API tokens for [service accounts](service-accounts.html) upon creation. You can also generate an API token at a later stage. To generate an API token for an existing **service account**:

1. Click the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"/> at the top right of the toolbar and select **Accounts**.
2. On the **Service Accounts** tab, click the ellipsis icon next to the service account for which you want to generate an API token, and select **Edit**.
3. To generate a new token, in the Tokens section, click **Generate**.

   You can have up to 20 tokens per service account at any given time. If you want to generate a new token but already have 20 tokens, then you must revoke one of the existing tokens.
4. To revoke a token, click the **Revoke** button next to the token.

   Revoking a token cannot be undone.
5. Select the appropriate permissions for the service account and click **Update**.



### Example: Invoke the API Using curl

With `curl`, you specify the API token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header. For example, to return all alerts, run the following command:

```shell
curl 'https://<wavefront_instance>/api/v2/alert' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <wavefront_api_token>'
```

## Generate an API Client Using Swagger

Because we expose the Wavefront REST API via Swagger, you can generate a working implementation of the API for the programming language or CLI you want to use.

{% include note.html content="Using the default Swagger configuration settings might result in errors. Create your own configuration file instead."%}

Here's an example for generating a Java client:

1. Create a file `swagger-config.json`. Here's an example:
```
{
"modelPackage": "com.wavefront.rest.models",
"apiPackage": "com.wavefront.rest.api.client",
"groupId": "com.wavefront.rest.api.client",
"artifactId": "wavefront-java-sdk",
"artifactVersion": "19.10",
"sourceFolder": "src/main/java",
"java8": true,
"dateLibrary": "java8"
}
```
2. Generate the client, for example:

`swagger-codegen generate -i https://mydomain.wavefront.com/api/v2/swagger.json -c swagger-config.json -l java`

## Wavefront REST API Categories

The REST API supports the following objects corresponding to different categories of management tasks:

- **Access Policy** - Lets you allow or deny access to embedded charts. For information, see [Allow or Deny Access to Embedded Charts](ui_sharing.html#allow-or-deny-access-to-embedded-charts).
- **Access** - Provides information on the access level of an entity. See [Notes on the Access Category](#access) below.
- **Account (User and Service Account)** - Allows users with [**Accounts** permission](permissions_overview.html) to retrieve a list of all [accounts](users_roles.html), create, update, and delete accounts and manage permissions and groups associated with accounts.
- **Alert** - Retrieve active, snoozed, in-maintenance, and invalid alerts. Users with [**Alerts** permission](permissions_overview.html) can create and update alerts.
- **ApiToken** - Allows users with [**Accounts** permission](permissions_overview.html) to retrieve, create, and manage API tokens. Used primarily in conjunction with service accounts.
- **Cloud Integration** - Retrieve cloud integration data types such as those available with the [AWS integration](integrations_aws_metrics.html). Users with [**Proxies** permission](permissions_overview.html) can add and remove cloud integration data types.
- **Dashboard** - Retrieve data about dashboards, list dashboards, and return version history. Users with [**Dashboards** permission](permissions_overview.html) can save, create, delete, clone, undelete dashboards.
- **Derived Metric** - Manage derived metrics.
- **Direct Ingestion** - Perform [direct ingestion](direct_ingestion.html) instead of using a proxy.
- **Event** - Retrieve events and tags associated with a specific event. Users with [**Events** permission](permissions_overview.html) can create, update, and delete events. Deleting events is limited to non-system events. System events include events based on alert firings, error events, and maintenance windows.
- **External Link** - Navigate external links. Users with [**External Links** permission](permissions_overview.html) can create, update, and delete external links.
- **Integration** - Retrieve integrations. Users with [**Integrations** permission](permissions_overview.html) can install and uninstall integration dashboards.

### Notes on the Access Category

The `/api/access/{entity}` endpoint provides information on how often an entity has been accessed.  Supported entities are metric, histogram, span.

{% include important.html content="In order to use this API, users must have both the Direct Data Ingestion and Metrics [permissions](permissions_overview.html)."%}

{% include note.html content="Tanzu Observability by Wavefront uses a bloom filter to determine the access pattern. As a result, even if data access returns true, there’s a very low probability that data actually hasn't been accessed. If data access returns false, it is guaranteed that the data has not been accessed.
"%}

This GET endpoint has the following parameters:

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="30%">Parameter</th><th width="70%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>Entity name,  e.g, cpu.usage (for a metric).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>hostPrefix</td>
<td>Prefix of the host name, e.g. you can use test-2a-app67 if the whole host name is test-2a-app57-id-12345 <br>
<strong>Warning:</strong>hostPrefix must be somewhat specific. There's a limit on how many hosts Tanzu Observability scans.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>usageThresholdDays</td>
<td>How many days to look back. 7 days by default.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>includeDailyDetail</td>
<td>Whether to provide additional data on daily usage. False by default.
<ul><li>If includeDailyDetail is false, GET returns true if the data has been accessed in the past usageThresholdDays, and false otherwise. </li>
<li>If includeDailyDetail is true, GET returns daily access details. </li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
