If you notice anomalies on your metrics charts or see that a service on the application map has large latency value, yse the Log Browser to troubleshoot your issues.

## Get Started with the Log Browser

To use the Log Browser:

1. Configure your application and the log shipper to [send logs to Tanzu Observability](logging_send_logs.html).
1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront instance and log in.
1. On the toolbar, click **Logs**.

The Log Browser offers the following information and options.

The information is color-coded, as follows:

## Enable or Disable Auto-Search

Auto search is a user-level setting, and you can enable or disable auto search.

* When auto-search is disabled, you need to click **Search** to get the search results.
* When auto-search is enabled, the search runs each time you add a source, tag, or text to the search bar.

## Search and Filter Logs

Follow these steps to search and filter logs:

1. Click the date picker to select a time window you want to see logs. A default time window is set for you based on your settings.
1. To get the list of logs you want, you have these options:
  * From the **Source** drop-down menu, select a [source](logging_overview.html#whats-a-tanzu-observability-log). You can filter logs by only one source.
  * In the **All Tags** list, click a tag and select a value from the list. You can filter logs by a combination of tags.
  * In the search bar, enter a word or expression and click **Search** or press Enter when [using the Keyboard to navigate](wavefront_keyboard_shortcuts.html#keyboard-shortcuts-and-their-usage). You can filter logs by a combination of words and expressions in the log messages.
  <br/>**Example: Combination of search terms**:
    ![Shows the error word on the search bad and the logs that contain the word error in them with error highlighted on the log messages](images/logging_search_key_word.png)

1. When you see the logs on the Log Browser, you can refine the search results further by using source, tags, and words or expressions as filters.

**Example:**
<ul>
        <li>
          If you type in a word(s) or type in <code>message={word(s)}</code>, the search results you see matches <code>message={word(s)}</code>. <br/>For example, if you type <code>warn</code> or <code>message=warn</code>, you see the search results for <code>message=warn</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you type <code>=error</code> on the search bar, you see search results for <code>message= =error</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you type <code>hello=</code> on the search bar, you see search results for <code>message= hello=</code>.
        </li>
</ul>

### Exclude or Include Logs from Search Results

You streamline what you see in the Log Browser by excluding tags, text, or a source.

* Click the equal (=) or not equal sign (â‰ ) next to a **Source** or tag value.
* Click a filter on the search bar and click the **Filter** or **Exclude** option.
* Double click a word, or select words on the **Message** column, and click **Exclude** or **Include**.

**Exclude Option Example**:

Click the application filter on the search bar, and click **Exclude application: wavefront**.

## Enable or Disable Auto-Load During Scroll

When you search and filter logs, you can decide how you want to scroll through the results:
* By default, you have to click **Load More Results** to load the next set of results.
  ![a screenshot showing the load more results text](images/logging_load_more_results.png)
* Enable scroll auto load to load logs as you scroll through the results, as follows:
  1. Click **Options** above the log results table (top right).
  1. Turn on **Scroll Auto-Load**.
  ![a screenshot of the steps mentioned above](images/logging_scroll_auto_load.png)


## Use the Chart to Drill Down

The histogram chart at the top of the Log Browser shows the number of logs distributed over the selected time window. The chart consists of 60 buckets. With the default 15-minute time window, each bar on the chart shows the number of logs for a 15-second time intervals.

If you notice a spike--which means more logs were sent--you can zoom in on the chart to analyze the data. As you zoom in, the table with the log data below the chart shows the data for the new time window.

Let's look at an example:

1. In the screenshot below, the histogram chart has three spikes.
    ![a screenshot of the Log Browser that shows a histogram with 3 spikes.](images/logging_histogram_spikes.png)
1. If you want to zoom in to the time window of the last spike, drag-select the area of interest.
    ![a screenshot of selecting the area on the histogram to to zoom in.](images/logging_histogram_zoomed_in.png)

   The chart shows the data for the zoomed-in time window and the logs in the log table below are updated to correspond to the new time window.
    ![a screenshot of the zoomed in histogram](images/logging_histogram_zoomed_in_data.png)
1. Click the minus (-) icon or one of the preset time windows (e.g. 30m) to zoom out.
    ![a screenshot with the zoom out options highlighted with a red box](images/logging_histogram_zoom_out.png)

## Customize the Log Data Table

The logs data table has the **Timestamp**, **Source**, and **Message** columns by default. Follow these steps to add columns with additional log data.

1. Click the add columns icon in the top left of the table.
    ![a screenshot of the table with the add column button highlighted](images/logging_log_table_add_column.png)
1. Select the columns that you want to add. The options you see are the tags you defined when sending the data to Tanzu Observability.

Here's an example that shows how to add the **tag** column.
