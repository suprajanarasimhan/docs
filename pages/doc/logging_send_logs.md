You can send logs to the Wavefront proxy from your log shipper or directly from your application. The Wavefront proxy sends the log data to the Wavefront instance.

![shows how data goes from the log shipper to the wavefront proxy and then to the Wavefront instance](images/logging_send_logs.png)

## Prerequisites

* A Wavefront account, which gives you access to a Wavefront instance.
  <!--If you donâ€™t have a cluster, [sign up for a free trial](https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability-trial).-->
* A Wavefront API token linked to an account with Proxy permission. See [Generating an API Token](wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token).
* Add the VMware domain (`*.vmware.com`) to the allowlist in your environment. If you want to narrow down the domain, contact your Tanzu Observability account representative.
  Because Tanzu Observability uses a VMware log cluster, you need to add the VMware domain to your allowlist to send log data successfully.

## Install Wavefront Proxy

The Wavefront proxy accepts a JSON array payload over HTTP. Follow these steps to install and configure the proxy version 11.3 or later.
1. Log into your Wavefront instance.
1. Select **Browse** > **Proxies**.
1. Click **Add Proxy** and follow the instructions on screen.
1. Edit the `wavefront.conf` file to open the `pushListenerPorts` to receive logs from the log shipper.
    <br/>For example:
    * If you installed the proxy on Linux, Mac, or Windows, open the [`wavefront.conf`](proxies_configuring.html#proxy-file-paths) file, uncomment the `pushListenerPorts` configuration property, and save the file. The port is set to 2878 by default.
    * If you installed the proxy on Docker, the command you use opens the `pushListenerPorts` and sets it to 2878.
1. [Start the proxy](proxies_installing.html#start-and-stop-a-proxy).

<!--
### Proxy Recommendations for Logs

When sending logs to the proxy we recommend the following:

* A standalone proxy cluster that only receives logs payloads.
* 2 CPUs
* 4 GB memory
* 2 instances of the proxy working behind a load balancer
* Add the following configurations:
    Example:
    ```
      - name: JAVA_HEAP_USAGE
        value: 2G

      - name: JVM_USE_CONTAINER_OPTS
        value: "false"
    ```

## Configure the Log Shipper

During Beta, use a log shipper, which scrapes and buffers your logs before sending them to the Wavefront proxy.

We support the [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/) log shipper. If you are using a different log shipper, contact [technical support](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_support_feedback.html#support).


Configure your log shipper:
  1. Install the log shipper. For example, [install Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/installation).

  1. Configure the log shipper to send data to the Wavefront proxy.
    1. Add the hostname of the host where the proxy runs
    2. Add the `pushListenerPorts` that you configured in the proxy.
  <br/>For example, edit the `fluent.conf` file to send data to a proxy as follows:

      ```
      <match wf.**>
        @type copy
        <store>
          @type http
          endpoint http://<proxy url>:<proxy port (example:2878)>/logs/json_array?f=logs_json_arr
          open_timeout 2
          json_array true
          <buffer>
            flush_interval 10s
          </buffer>
        </store>
      </match>
      ```
  1. Tag the logs with the application and service name as part of preprocessing. Otherwise, the Wavefront proxy adds the service and application tags to the log data and assigns the value `none`.

### Best Practices

If logs exceed the maximum character limit for a message, tag, and value, the Wavefront proxy drops the logs. Ensure that your logs are within the given limits. See [How Do I track Data Blocked by the Wavefront Proxy](logging_faq.html#how-do-i-track-data-blocked-by-the-wavefront-proxy).

{% include note.html content="To increase the limits, ask your administrator to reach out to [technical support](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_support_feedback.html#support)." %}

## Map the Traces and Metrics to Logs

To get the unified observability experience and drill down from traces to logs and metrics in dashboards or charts to logs, you need to update your settings so that your traces and metrics map to the logs sent from your application. Contact [technical support](wavefront_support_feedback.html#support) to update the settings.

## View Logs

When the data is in Tanzu Observability, you can use the Log Browser to filter and search logs, and drill into logs from charts, alerts, Application Map page, and the Traces Browser. See [View Logs and Troubleshoot](logging_overview.html#view-logs-and-troubleshoot).
