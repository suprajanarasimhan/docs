## Summary
```
align(<timeWindow>,[mean|median|min|max|first|last|sum|count,] <tsExpression>)

align(<timeWindow>, <hsExpression>)
```

You can use `align()` with time series and with histograms.

## Description

You can use `align()`:
* With time series.
* With histogram series.

### Time-series Function

The `align()` time-series function adjusts the display of each time series described by the expression, by grouping the data values into buckets of the specified duration and then returning a single displayed value for each bucket.

By default, each returned value is the mean (average) of the values that were reported in a bucket. You can specify a different summarization method if you want the bucketed values to be aggregated in some other way (e.g. counted, summed, etc.). For example, if your time series reports data once a minute, but you want the data values to be displayed every 30 minutes (and summarized by median over that time window), use `align(30m, median, ts(my.metric))`.

`align()` returns values at intervals that start at the beginning of epoch time (Jan 1, 1970).
For example, `align(2d, ts(my.metric))` produces a value at every 48-hour interval starting with `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`.

`align()` returns each value at the beginning of the interval that contains the data values it summarizes.
For example, suppose `align(1m, sum, ts(my.metric))` returns a value at 10:05:00pm. This returned value is the sum of the values reported by `my.metric` from 10:05:00pm to 10:05:59pm.

Metrics are automatically pre-aligned for performance reasons when more than 100 time series are used in an aggregation function. You might see a pre-align warning even if you're not using the `align()` function. You can ignore the warning in most cases, for instance, if a metric reflects a parameter changing over time.

You can use any supported unit of time for the `timeWindow` parameter. The `bw` unit, which stands for bucket window, enforces the summarization option in the query instead of the chart. For example, `align(1bw, [{mean|median|min|max|first|last|sum},] <tsExpression>)` produces a chart that looks identical, regardless of summarization method that you choose in the chart.
Using `bw` can also improve query performance on larger time windows where you normally align to a smaller interval like 1 minute. For example, `rawsum(align(1m, <tsExpression>))` can be optimized by using `rawsum(align(1bw, <tsExpression>))`.

### Histogram Function

The `align()` histogram function adjusts the granularity of each histogram series described by the expression. Within each series, `align()` groups the histogram distributions into buckets of the specified duration, and then merges the distributions in each group to produce a single composite distribution for each bucket. For example, `align(1h, hs(my.hsMetric.m))` merges groups of per-minute distributions to produce hourly distributions.

This function merges the centroids and counts to produce composite histogram distributions.

You typically use `align()` as part of an input [`hsExpression`](query_language_reference.html#query-expressions) that you specify to another histogram query function, for example, `max(align(10m, hs(users.settings.numberOfApiTokens.m)))`

You can visualize `align()` by running it as a top-level query under a time-series chart. Doing so displays a time series that consists of just the median values from the distributions in each returned histogram series. The chart for `align(hs(my.hsMetric.m))` is the same as the chart for `median(align(hs(my.hsMetric.m)))`.

## Examples

### Time-series Function

The following example shows a simple query for requests latency in a Stacked Column chart.

Next we put the results into 5 minute buckets.

Finally, we use `max` as the alignment algorithm. The default for `align()` is `median()`

### Histogram Function

This chart represents the histogram series that is described by the expression `hs(alerting.check.latency.m, customer="perftest")`. The chart shows the histogram series as a line that consists of the median values of the distributions. The line contains one median value per minute.

![hs_align_before](images/hs_align_base.png)

Now we align the per-minute distributions into 10-minute buckets:

```align(10m, hs(alerting.check.latency.m))```

Aligning merges the histogram distributions "horizontally" to produce a less granular series of composite distributions. The chart displays the results as a single line that consists of the median values of the composite distributions.  The line contains one median value every 10 minutes.
